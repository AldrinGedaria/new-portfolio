                    My hard work and dedication did not go unnoticed, and I were awarded the <span>Outstanding Intern <img class="highlight" src="/IMAGES/01.SIGNOPSYS/highlight.svg" alt="highlights"></span>(May)  and <span>Leadership Excellence Award <img class="highlight-v2" src="/IMAGES/01.SIGNOPSYS/highlight-v2.svg" alt="highlight-v2"></span>(June).
